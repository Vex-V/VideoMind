"""Chunking, exercised on synthetic boundary events rather than on footage.

`fuse` is the piece the whole pipeline rests on and the piece with no model in
it, so it can be tested exactly. AT-16 -- silent, cut-free footage must yield
multiple usable chunks rather than one span -- is a property of weight
redistribution, which is checked here directly rather than inferred from a clip.
