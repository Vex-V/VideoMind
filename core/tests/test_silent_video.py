"""A video with no audio track at all.

Both committed fixtures (`media/test.mp4`, `media/speech_test.mp4`) carry an
audio stream, so nothing exercised the case where `container.streams.audio` is
empty - which is ordinary input: CCTV exports, screen captures, anything muxed
with `-an`. It used to raise `IndexError: tuple index out of range` out of
`audio_extract`, three frames below the ingest call.

The clip is synthesised here rather than committed: it needs no models, and a
2-second 64x48 file makes the property under test - no audio stream - obvious
in a way a binary blob does not.
