-- video_core — the application's view of a video analysed by core/ (FalconVQA).
--
-- Purely additive. `videos` (the VideoDB-shaped table) is left in place and is
-- no longer read by anything; nothing here drops or alters it.
--
-- Run after schema.sql, which owns `projects`, `update_updated_at()` and the
-- `project-assets` bucket this table's `storage_path` points into.
--
-- Note the two Supabase projects: this one holds the row, and core's own
-- project holds the bytes. `source_url` points at the object the browser
-- uploaded here; `playback_url` points at core's public copy, which is what
-- actually plays. Both are kept on purpose — see MIGRATION.md, D1.
